	<p>Modern task tracking application, that follows <a href = "#featureOpen">open standards</a> and supports <a href = "#featureTags">tags</a>, <a href = "#featureSubtasks">subtasks</strong> and <a href = "#features">more.</a></p>
</div>

<div id = "features">
<ul>
	<li id = "featureOpen">
		<h2>Open Source &amp; Open Standards</h2>

		<p>Don't wait on companies to write code for you, don't get locked into their standards. Import and export your data from wacky-tracky.</p>
	</li>

	<li id = "featureTags">
		<h2>Tags</h2>

		<p>Tag your tasks to make them easier to find later. You can tag things like "important", "friends" and "TODO!", make up any tag you like.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h2>Free as in "free beer"</h2>

		<p>The project is open source under GPLv2. We'll never charge you for the source code, so if you don't want a hosted version, you can run your own.</p>
	</li>

	<li id = "featureSubtasks">
		<h2>Unlimited levels of sub tasks!</h2>
		<p>You can have subtasks, then sub tasks of subtasks, then subtasks of subtasks of subtasks. All subtasks are first class tasks, and support tagging, notes, etc.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h2>REST API</h2>

		<p>Are you a developer? Well, wacky-tracky's server is designed from the ground up to act as a REST API. This means you could happily write third party clients/tools to use wacky-tracky.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h2>You own your data</h2>

		<p>Get data in with import features, and get data out with export features. If you don't trust us, host your own copy of wacky-tracky. We're open and respect your freedom.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h2>Due dates</h2>

		<p>When did you want to complete a task by? Set a Due Date using the easy date picker to find out.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h2>Rich Text Editor for notes</h2>
	
		<p>Sometimes you can't make everything into a task and you just have to write a wall of text. Because of this, every task has a big text block for notes too.</p>
	</li>
